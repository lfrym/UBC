    "The goal of this problem is to compare the outcomes of matching algorithms under three scenarios. Under the first scenario, rankings will be completely randomized at the level of each individual student. This is equivalent to what is known as a \"random serial dictatorship\" mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, each school will have its own specific ranking across all students. Under these conditions, the deferred acceptance algorithm is not Pareto-efficient, but dominates all other mechanisms which eliminate so-called \"justified envy\" - that is, a situation where a student prefers to attend another school, at which she is ranked higher than another current assignee. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the third scenario, I weaken the justified envy restriction such that a student with a higher ranking must only have a better opportunity to be accepted. This allows me to implement a Pareto-efficient mechanism called the top trading cycles mechanism. Using this algorithm, I can count the number of re-matchings from the second scenario that would allow students to attend more-preferred schools.\n",
