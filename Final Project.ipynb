    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, each school will have its own specific ranking across all students. Under these conditions, the deferred acceptance algorithm is not Pareto-efficient, but dominates all other mechanisms which eliminate so-called \"justified envy\" - that is, a situation where a student prefers to attend another school, at which she is ranked higher than another current assignee. \n",

    "In the third scenario, I weaken the justified envy restriction such that a student with a higher ranking must only have a better opportunity to be accepted. This allows me to implement a Pareto-efficient mechanism called the top trading cycles mechanism. Using this algorithm, I can count the number of re-matchings from the second scenario that would allow students to attend more-preferred schools.\n",
